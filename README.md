#### osquery
osquery __is an open-source security tool__ that takes an operating system and turns it into one giant database, with tables that you can query. With these queries, you can monitor file integrity, check on the status and configuration of the firewall, perform security audits of the target server, and more.

#### Graphene
Graphene is a Python library for building APIs with GraphQL easily. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
